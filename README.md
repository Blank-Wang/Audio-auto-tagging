# Development of a Convolutional Neural Network for multilabel auto tagging of music audio files

In general, music audio files can be accompanied by metadata related to their content such as free text description or tags. Tags are proved to be more useful as they provide a more direct description of the audio file and can be used in tasks such as classification per gender, artist, musical instrument etc in recommendation systems related to music. As not all audio files are accompanied by tags, the need of auto-tagging arises.

The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have, after recent successes in image and text retrieval, also have been actively adopted in the field of music information retrieval. The goal of the project is the construction of a CNN that performs auto-tagging on audio files. The project was developed using Python Tensorflow.
